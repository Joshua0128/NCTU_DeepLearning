### Coursework
 submit form: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScGgaTCzsXwxhuxizLduURIBNGlOgedYCOb5gkJYwsHoAouRA/viewform
 
 Please submit .ipynb files

* Use nearest neighbor method to do handwritten digit recognition
* (Optional) Use PCA to speed up the above method
* Handcraft a feedforward neural network that solves the problem of
    * input a binary representation of a number and classify by it's remainder when divided by 4 (with 100% accuracy)
    * input a binary representation of a number and classify by it's remainder when divided by 3 (with high accuracy)
    * input is a 3x3 board, each cell is either white or black. Check whether there are any 3 white cell are in a row (like the game tic-tac-toe)

## Week03
Coursework
* Handcraft a CNN network to generate the next step of the game of life.
* Use numpy to write a simple neural network and use a gradient descent algorithm to train it for classifying  digits in the MNIST dataset.
* Train a neural network to classify digits in the MNIST dataset.
* Train a neural netowork to classify classes in the cifar10 dataset.
