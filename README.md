## Week01-Week02
Coursework
* Use nearest neighbor method to do handwritten digit recognition
* Use PCA to speed up the above method
* Handcraft a feedforward neural network that solves the problem of
    * input a binary representation of a number and classify by it's remainder when divided by 4 (with 100% accuracy)
    * input a binary representation of a number and classify by it's remainder when divided by 3 (with high accuracy)
    * input is a 3x3 board, each cell is either white or black. Check whether there are any 3 white cell are in a row (like the game tic-tac-toe)
